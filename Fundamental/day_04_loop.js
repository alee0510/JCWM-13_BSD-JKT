/* ‚ôæ Loops: for, while, and do...while  
when we are code, sometime we need to performs a task repeatedly. in JavaScript we do that
with loop. there 3 type of loop in JavaScript, for..., while..., and do...while... 
loop in JavaScript statements in JavaScript are similar to conditional statements if...else...,
which are blocks of code that will execute if a specified condition results in true.

/* 2Ô∏è‚É£ While Loop
    In JavaScript, a while statement is a loop that executes as long as the specified condition 
    evaluates to true. it can cause infinite loop when we set condition always true.
    syntax :
    while (condition) {
        // execute code as long as condition is true
    }

/* 3Ô∏è‚É£ do...while...
    which is very similar to while with the major difference being that a do...while 
    loop will always execute once, even if the condition is never true.
    syntax :
    do {
        // execute code
    } while (condition)
