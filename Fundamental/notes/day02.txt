/* Code Structure
📒 The first thing we’ll study is the building blocks of code and syntax type rule in JavaScript
🔠 STATEMENET
    Statements are syntax constructs and commands that perform actions.
    We’ve already seen a statement, alert('Hello, world!'), which shows the message “Hello, world!”.
    Multiple statement separated by semicolon
        alert('Hello'); alert('world'); 
            or
        alert('Hello');
        alert('World');

🥓 SEMICOLON
    A semicolon may be omitted in most cases when a line break exists. the notation ; is optional,
    use to separated multiple statement especially inline statement
    alert('Hello')
    alert('world')
    but needed in multiple inline statement alert('Hello'); alert('world');

💬 COMMENT
    used for notation or documentation of our code, comment will not be executed by JS engine,
    there several comment type : 
    // this is inline comment
    /*
    this is multiple 
    line comment
    */
// ⚠ Nested comments are not supported 

/* Variable 🛸🛸🛸
what we do in programming is mostly related to data and how we can manipulate the data? first, 
we need something that can store data, in JavaScript and other programming language is commonly 
called variable. Variables in JavaScript are containers which hold reusable data. 
They like a box that we can fill stuff and this staff can be change anytime so that 
make the box reusable.
*/

// declaring variable using 'var' keyword, syntax --> var variableName

// variable only need declare once
// assign value to variable using '='

/* NOTE : 📦 variable naming rule : 
    - Names should begin with lowercase string.
    - Names cannot contain symbols or begin with symbols.
    - Names cannot begin with a number.
    - Names can contain a mix of uppercase strings, lowercase strings, and numbers.
 ⚠ use variable only when we use the value multiple times or make it reusable
 in JavaScript Case matters, 'apple and AppLe is different 🔖'
*/

// change variable value

/* 💡 Modern JavaScript variable declaration : let and const
the variable type 'let' shares a lot of similarities with var but unlike var has scope constraints.
const, is a variable type (not really, but you’ll find out now) assigned to data whose value cannot 
and will not be changed throughout the script. 
⚠ NOTE : When declaring variables, it is good practice to avoid us NOTE :
